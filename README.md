# ðŸ•’ðŸ¤– Inquiry-Reminder

Inquiry Reminder is a Slack bot developed for the July 2022 Zensurance Hackathon that scans for unresolved inquiries in #team-core-ticket-clarification. If any of these inquires go stale (no conversation/resolution within 30 minutes) the bot sends a reminder to IA to respond to that inquiry. Upon receiving this reminder, IA has the option to increase the timer beyond 30 minutes so that the bot can remind IA later if they need more time.
